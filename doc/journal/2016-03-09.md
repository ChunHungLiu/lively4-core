2 hours self-supporting Lively4 development and now we have lots of new features and bug fixes:

- All elements can now have a context menu. It is inked either through a window button or through right clicking on a halo target.
- The context menu allows to directly browse to the template definition of elements. 
- Objects in the menu are now opened on where the menu was clicked
- Removed the static module dependency to "lively" in the [context-menu.js](../src/client/contextmenu.js), because System.js did use an old version of the module...
- Refactored [lively-container](../templates/lively-container.html) to display the editor not in the content element. 
- Refactored the [lively.js](../src/client/lively.js) to use the standart "default export class ClassName" synatx, because the event handlers kept using the reference in "var lively = class Lively"
