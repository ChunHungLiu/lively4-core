When using script tags to load external scripts, the browser waits for the first 
to load before loading the second. The result looks like this. 

```
Script1
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:50:03 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
Script2
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:50:03 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
Script3
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:50:03 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
```

In our lively-container, we dynamically create script tags and add them to the 
dom and the result looks like this. 

```
Script1
Script2
Script3
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:49:31 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:49:31 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
Hello Wed Nov 16 2016 11:49:31 GMT+0100 (W. Europe Standard Time)
```

This (among some other issues) prevented blockly from loading in lively-container. So let's fix it. 


## 2016-11-08 Diff-Match-Patch again, #Jens

When implementing not-git-only conflict resolution when saving over an already edited file, we 
have to perform a three-way-merge. And here we can fall back on Google's excelent diff-match-patch lib. 

```JS
import diff from 'src/external/diff-match-patch.js';

var a = "abc"  // Source
var b = "abc2" // Edit 1
var c = "a3bc" // Edit 2

var dmp = new diff.diff_match_patch()

var diff1 = dmp.diff_main(a, b);  // 0,abc,1,2
var diff2 = dmp.diff_main(a, c);  // 0,a,1,3,0,bc
// dmp.diff_cleanupSemantic(diff1);

var patch1 = dmp.patch_make(diff1)
// @@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
//  abc
// +2

var patch2 = dmp.patch_make(diff2)
// @@ -1,3 +1,4 @@
//  a
// +3
//  bc


var merge = dmp.patch_apply(patch1.concat(patch2), a)
// -> a3bc2,true,true
var d = merge[0] // -> a3bc2
```

## 2016-11-04 Fun with Transformations,  #Jens

Marcel asked if we can still rotate a star in Lively4. I said no... but did not want to disappoint him in the end. 
```
function rotate(x) {

	that.style = "transform: perspective(2000px) rotateY("+x+"deg )";
		

	window.setTimeout(rotate, 10, x+0.4)
}

rotate(0)
```


## 2016-10-20 #Jens

The wintersemester just began and I welcome all new Lively4 users in [SWD16](SWD16). 

### Scripting the lively-sync tool to develop new lively-server features

```
// open sync tool and login
var synctool = document.querySelector("lively-sync")
await fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4S2/_git/versions", {
	headers: {
		gitemail: 		await synctool.loadValue("githubEmail"),
		gitusername:	await synctool.loadValue("githubUsername"),
		gitpassword:	await synctool.loadValue("githubToken"),

## 2016-07-20 #Jens

Short discussion of [dependencies between modules](Dependencies)

## 2016-06-08 #Jens

Fun with Layers... and modules. 

Creating a layers should feel the same as creating functions or classes. That means that I don't want to do it so explicitly like:

```
var DevLayer = new cop.Layer()
DevLayer.name = "DevLayer" // for introspection...
```

There is for my taste... to much redundancy here.


So there the default syntax we used in ContextJS was the following:
```
cop.create("DevLayer")
```

This implicitly registered the `DevLayer` in a global scope. The explicit form would be:

```
cop.create(window, "DevLayer")
```

But since global state seems not to be en vouge any more, lets look if we can get our layers into the module local state. And thangs to some implemntation knwoledge... we can!

```
import * as cop from "src/../../ContextJS/Layers.js"

cop.create(__lvVarRecorder, "DevLayer").refineObject(d3, {
	select(name) {
		console.log("select " + name)
		return cop.proceed.apply(arguments)
	}	
})

```

But sadly... since `__lvVarRecorder` is a lexical variable we cannot access it. But I guess, this is exactly what I want now. 

## 2016-05-30 #Tim

Pulling Babelsberg into Lively4... Here are some replacements I did to convert
Lively modules and classes into ES6 modules:

```
src.replace(/(\s+)([0-9a-zA-Z$_]+): function/g, "$1$2")

src.replace(/([a-zA-Z0-9$_]+).subclass\('([a-zA-Z0-9$_]+)', {/g, "class $2 extends $1 {")

src.replace(/^}\);\s*$/g, "}")

src.replace(/^(\s+)},\s*$/g, "$1}")
```

And here are some for converting prototype-stuff into classes:

```
replace(/XYZ.prototype.([a-zA-Z0-9$_]+) = function/, "$1")

replace(/XYZ.prototype\['([a-zA-Z0-9$_]+)'\] = function/, "$1")
```

And here some stuff for tests into mocha tests:
```
/^(\s+)test([a-zA-Z0-9$_]+): function/ => "$1it('should $2', function"
/^(\s+)},/ => "$1})"
```

## 2016-05-26 #Tim, #Jens

Prototyping the Template extration again....

```JS
var name = "lively-joe",
	prevP = that.style.position,
	prevL = that.style.left,
	prevT = that.style.top;
that.style.position = "";
that.style.left = "";
that.style.top = "";
lively.files.saveFile("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/lively4-core/templates/" + name + ".html",
	`<template id="${name}">
	${that.outerHTML} 
</template>
<script class="registrationScript">lively.registerTemplate()</script>`)
that.style.position = prevP;
that.style.left = prevL;
that.style.top = prevT;
```

		lively.modules.installHook("fetch", function workspaceFetch(proceed, load) { 
			if (load.address.match("workspace://")) return Promise.resolve("")
			return proceed(load)
		})
	}
	return lively.modules.runEval(str, {targetModule: "workspace://1", context: this}).then( x => x.value)
}
```

	})	



	
window.moduleName = lively4url +"/src/client/draft.js"

System.import(moduleName).then(m => window.draft = m)

draft.hello()  // "world4"

lively.modules.moduleEnv(moduleName).recorder.bar = function() { return 3 + 4}

draft.hello() // "world7"

lively.modules.sourceOf(moduleName).then(
  source => lively.openWorkspace(source).then(comp => {
    comp.doSave = (source) => {
      lively.notify("save: " )
      var source =  comp.editor.getValue()
      lively.modules.moduleSourceChange(moduleName,  source)
    }
  })
)


draft.hello function hello() {
        return 'world' + __lvVarRecorder.bar();
    }
lively.modules.sourceOf(moduleName).then( source => that.editor.setValue(source))

// edit source

lively.modules.moduleSourceChange(moduleName,  that.editor.getValue())

draft.hello() // whatever....

lively.vm.


```



##  2016-05-01, #Jens

Major Lively4 UI refactoring and fixes!


Originating in while working on some simple JavaScript to HTML scripts... then in the end are not so easy to use, because the context is missing and we cannot attach callback to pure ASCII text. Or can I? #TODO #Idea... we control both worlds at that time.

```
<lively-content-script><script type="code">
lively.files.statFile(lively4url +"")
  .then(t => JSON.parse(t).contents.map(ea => ea.name))
  .then(files => files.filter(ea => !ea.match(/^[.]/)))
  .then(files =>  "" + lively4url +"/" + 
      "<ul style='background-color:lightgray'>" + files.map(ea => "<li><a href='"+ea+"'>" + ea + "</a></li>").join("\n") + "</ul>")
</script></lively-content-script>
```

<lively-content-script><script type="code">
lively.files.statFile(lively4url +"")
  .then(t => JSON.parse(t).contents.map(ea => ea.name))
  .then(files => files.filter(ea => !ea.match(/^[.]/)))
  .then(files =>  "" + lively4url +"/" + 
      "<ul style='background-color:lightgray'>" + files.map(ea => "<li><a href='"+ea+"'>" + ea + "</a></li>").join("\n") + "</ul>")
</script></lively-content-script>

### I am so Eval!

Sometimes, I think one has to hit code with a hammer as long and hard till it glows...

Sorry Robert, sorry Stefan... but I want to bind my "this" in my workspace.

I want to be able to select this line and depending on the context eval it to something meaningful.

```
 "I am "+ this 
```


## 2016-04-28, #Jens

- Polished lively4-server self-supporting development workflow.
- lively-sync now fully supports commit messages
- Implemented server side search service and a draft of a search widget

## 2016-04-27, #Jens

Getting the commit that last changed a file... e.g. the revision numer of a file with git.

```
 git log -n1 --format=%H writetest.txt
```

### Working on lively4-server from within lively4

Ok, we talked about it and thought lets wait until the livel4-services project can gives us a live view on a terminal...

But then todays seminar came and here it is, the line of code that kills our lively server.

```
fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/_meta/exit").then(r => r.text()).then(t => lively.notify(t))
```

This would be the end, if the lively4-server would not automatically restart itself. This is a bit pointless, because we cannot directly edit the source code of the server. 

We could allow the server to directly edit its own source code, but that would only work until someone adds the first syntax error and then we are lost again.

And now we need a magic trick: our lively4.sh that restarts the server, just pulls in the latest changes from github before restarting the server. This allows us to use any means to fix the code on github and then the server will ressourect from the dead! And we are online again! 

We even could start simply start the lively4-server twice and they could edit each other indefinately as long as they dont force kill each other at the same time.


We could run it under https://lively-kernel.org/lively4S2 for example. And now we do.

We have two server running... wich are actually the same codebase, but use two different development speeds.

The first watches githup and has to be killed/restarted explicitly but will update automatically. The second server (lively4S2) will can edit itself or be edited through lively4 and will be killed/restarted whenever the httpServer.js files changes. I use a crude selfmade script to do this, but there should be many nice file watchers out there we should reuse. #Refactoring #TODO

The allows now for a really comfortable workflow: 

- edit the httpServer.js from within lively4 and press save
- lively4S2 gets restarted and the new behavior can immediatly be tried out
- using the liverly-sync tool, the changes can be commited and pushed to github
- by killing the first lively4-server explicitly, it will get the new code and before restarting itself

From now on I can work on the server code without having to log into via the terminal and ssh.

### Finished Sync Tool: Implemented Branching and Merging

Now that the Github Sync Tool can also checkout/create branches and merge other branches, I consider it feature complete.  More complex merge opertations and history control will require manual usage of git or a different kind of tool. 


## 2016-04-20, #Jens

- Setup Wiki pages for [WebDev16](WebDev16)
- TestRunner 
  <button onclick='lively.components.openInWindow(lively.components.createComponent("lively-testrunner"))'>test runner</button>
- Hot fixed a [bugin mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/2112) #WhatShallWeDo

### Night Time Hacking

Make event listeners in modules runtime programm ready.

Previously, I wraped the event handler in an anonymous function... so I could exchange the method in the selecting.js module without reregistering the event handler. But when evaluating the module twice, the event handler get also registered multiple times making live programming not feasable. 
```
$("body")[0].addEventListener('mousedown', (evt) => this.handleMouseDown(evt),true)
$("body")[0].addEventListener('mouseup', (evt) => this.handleMouseUp(evt),true)
$("body")[0].addEventListener('click', (evt) => this.handleSelect(evt),true)
$("body")[0].addEventListener('click', (evt) => this.handleSelect(evt),true)
```

So I implemented ``removeEventListener`` and ``addEventListener`` in ``lively`` that makes the event listeners available for reflection... such as removing them by a pattern.

```
lively.removeEventListener("selecting") // in case of a reload
lively.addEventListener("selecting", document.body, 'mousedown', (evt) => this.handleMouseDown(evt), true)
lively.addEventListener("selecting", document.body, 'mouseup', (evt) => this.handleMouseUp(evt), true)
lively.addEventListener("selecting", document.body, 'click', (evt) => this.handleSelect(evt), true)
```

Now the way is free to do what I actually wanted to do: fix the halo selection.  


## 2016-04-13, #Jens

Finally, I got the hang of streaming with fetch... it seems that it is not so easy..

based on https://jakearchibald.com/2015/thats-so-fetch/ 
```JS
// https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/lively4-core/templates/lively-container.html
fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/_git/diff", {
    headers: new Headers({ 
    	"gitrepository": "lively4-core",
    })
  }).then(function(response) {
  var reader = response.body.getReader();
  var decoder = new TextDecoder();


  (function read() {
    reader.read().then(function(result) {
      var text = decoder.decode(result.value || new Uint8Array, {
        stream: !result.done
      });
      console.log("RESULT " + text)
      if (result.done) {
        console.log("DONE")
      } else {
        read() // fetch next chunk
      }
    })
  })()
  
})

```

### Fun with Lively2 Loader

Lets shake it... 

```JS
window.r=0
function rockit() {
$('div').each(function() {
	this.style.transform = 'rotate('+(Math.random()*2*r - r)+'deg)'
})
r += 0.05

	setTimeout(rockit, 200)
}
rockit()
```

### Global Key Handler

I fixed general text selection in livley and added a global *DoIt* (CTRL+D) for selected text.


Try it out:
```
alert("hello")
```


But, we need to refactor keys.js and shortcuts.js into one. #TODO #REFACTOR




## 2016-04-08, #Jens

Fixed and extended side-bar navigation. 


## 2016-04-08, #Jens

Is introducing the "sync" button into the lively container / browser a good idea? Or should we do it more automatically? 


### Playing around with global error handling

```JS
 
 window.onerror = function onerror(message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
  	window.LastError = error
  	lively.notify("Error: ", message, 20, () => 
  		lively.openWorkspace("Error:" + message + "\nLine:" + lineno + " Col: " + colno+"\nSource:" + source + "\nError:" + error.stack))
 };
 // window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', 
 
 lively.handleReject = function(evt) {
  window.onerror("Unhandled Promise Reject: " + evt.reason.message,null,null,null,evt.reason)
 }
 window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', (evt) => lively.handleReject(evt) );
 
```
This can intercept aysnc errors like:
```JS
 setTimeout(() => foo.foo(), 10)
```

But what about errors in Promises?
```JS
 fetch("https:///lively4/").then( () => foo.foo())
 Promise.resolve().delay(500).then(()=>{throw new Error()})
```

### Making sense of native error massages

Maybe the parsing of the error messages may help...

- https://github.com/stacktracejs/stacktrace-gps
- https://github.com/stacktracejs/error-stack-parser


I know, that we will do better by using our own debber infrastructure... and we will, eventually.

## Code Navigation

I would like to have something like:   http://sevin7676.github.io/Ace.Tern/demo.html#javascript

Not for the autocompletion, which is nice, but for navigation between code and all....






## 2016-04-07, #Jens

Now, we can also edit the wiki. 

```JS
fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/_git/sync", {
    headers: new Headers({ 
    	"gitrepository": "Lively4.wiki",
        "gitusername" : "jens.lincke",
        "gitpassword" : "f777a0fa178bc855c28f89b402786b3....."
    })
  }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log)
```

So we also have a UI for it:

<lively-sync />


## 2016-04-06, #Jens

The approaching seminar makes it necessary to also support multiple users in our node.js server and 
I replaced the auto commit that always used my credentials with a special control method in our server that triggers a sync with github. That request can be customized with username and github token that we get from via oauth anyway...

Now we have to build some UI and integrate it into our workflow... 

```JS
fetch("https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/_git/sync", {
    headers: new Headers({ 
    	"gitusername" : "jens.lincke",
    	"gitpassword" : "f777a0fa178bc855c28f89b402786b3....."
    })
  }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log)
```
We can also provide a commit messages so that it will not use the default....

## 2016-03-23, #Jens

Our chrome extension has a new friend... a custom code editor in Lively4! 

A new context menu entry "Customize Page" opens a workspace that allows to edit code that is run for every page under that domain. As a test I modified my private amazon page, listing all my bought things on that page on a workspace... only 10 and not all, but it is a start. I picked that information because different to other typical information on a website, this content lies behind some authentification barriers that are hard to get through on a command line. I cannot simply paste the url and do some "curl", "grep" and "sed" magic. But using Lively I can start to get the information right from the original page. 

```JS
lively.array($('h1'))
	.filter(ea => ea.textContent.match("Meine Bestellungen")).forEach( ea => {
		ea.style.backgroundColor ="gray"
		ea.title = "Lively4: Open as workspace"
		ea.onclick = evt => {
			var text = lively.array($(".a-link-normal"))
				.filter(ea => ea.href.match(/product/))
				.map(ea => ea.textContent.replace(/\n/g,"").replace(/ +/," "))
				.filter(ea => ea.match(/[^ ]/))
				.join("\n")
			lively.openWorkspace(text, evt).then( comp => 
				comp.changeMode("text"));
		}
})
```

At the moment this script is not different from any page monkey patching, but it is one step further of #Astrid's dream of persistently customizing her facebook page, just by deleting some elements and moving others around. We have moving and deleting now and we have a simple form of persitence per page (or in this case per domain). We just need it now to bring together!

Any volunteers? 


## 2016-03-20, #Tim

Embedding other pages is difficult. The X-Frame-Options header in many responses (e.g. from Google, Facebook) indicate to the browser that it shouldn't show the page in an iframe or object tag. We cannot remove that tag from the response with the service worker, because iframe and object requests do not pass through the service worker.

## Idea #Jens

But, Robert Krahn proposed that we can control such flags when we pass all request through our own proxy, as we did often had to do in Lively Kernel any way. Sp in principal instead of browsing http://google.com directly, we go through http://ourproxy.com/google.com.

But could we do so when initialy going through that proxy any way? Since we opened a service worker on a specific domain, e.g. https://lively-kernel.github.io/lively4-core/. And we install a service worker for a domain. Then opening a page under  https://lively-kernel.github.io/lively4-core/proxy/* should go through a service worker if that service worker is running, or not?

I was rereading a post[ "Taking it to Th'emacs"](http://gbracha.blogspot.de/2014/08/taking-it-to-themacs.html) of Gilad Bracha again when I rediscovered a very related project: [Leisure](http://zot.github.io/Leisure/?load=elisp/README.org) was mentioned side  by side of Lively Kernel in this post. And the current UI experience makes it very similar to what I we are aiming in Lively4 and our lively-container. Luckily, the project seems to heavily rely on a running Emacs and its org mode... but we will see. Definitly, some very related work! #RelatedWork #Lively4 #LiterateProgramming #ActiveEssays #DynamicMedia

## 2016-03-11, #Jens

Thinking, about adding search capability with [search-index](https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/search-index)

- it support server and client side indexing and search
- the seach index is persistent 
- the index can be moved between client and server 
- the index can be backed up in a file, e.g we can store it in a dropbox

This should allow us to combine personal but still private lively search experience for all the different resources a user has access to!

Also thinking about using PDF.js for displaying papers and its annotations...

### Playing with Objects

```HTML
<div style="width: 238px; height: 115px; position: relative; max-width: none; max-height: none; left: 28px; top: 22px; background-color: blue;" id="foo"><button style="left: 132px; top: 46px;">Color</button></div>
```

```JavaScript
that.innerHTML = "<button>Color</button>"
that.

System.import
that.id = "foo"

that.style.backgroundColor = "gray"
that.id = "tosave"
that.v = 3

that.v = 4
lively.showElement(get('#tosave'))

get('#tosave').innerHTML 

get("foo")


window.get = (name ) => document.querySelector(name)
HTMLElement.get = function(name ) { document.querySelector("#" +name)

get('tosave')
```


### Nice use case of Livel4Chrome...

I had to get the list of our mailinglist subsribers...
So I went to its website. I could not find an export link, but just the list as an HTML table...

So I opened a Workspace and wrote a little script.

```
_.select(_.map($("td"), ea => ea.textContent), ea => ea.match(/@/)).join("\n")
```

I don't do this very often, but I would like to be able to add a persistent button on that specific page, that everytime I go there I will have it easier to get the plain list. 




## 2016-03-09, Long after Midnight, #Jens

2 hours self-supporting Lively4 development and now we have lots of new features and bug fixes:

- All elements can now have a context menu. It is inked either through a window button or through right clicking on a halo target.
- The context menu allows to directly browse to the template definition of elements. 
- Objects in the menu are now opened on where the menu was clicked
- Removed the static module dependency to "lively" in the [context-menu.js](../src/client/contextmenu.js), because System.js did use an old version of the module...
- Refactored [lively-container](../templates/lively-container.html) to display the editor not in the content element. 
- Refactored the [lively.js](../src/client/lively.js) to use the standart "default export class ClassName" synatx, because the event handlers kept using the reference in "var lively = class Lively"




## 2016-03-08, International Women's Day!

And yet again, here it is... a Lively Journal. This time in a standard wiki in GitHub... and at the same time also as a [Lively page](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/Wiki/Journal.md).

The journal is written using a unified browser inside a Lively4 page using a lively-container. 

- created a page describing [Lively4](Lively4)


### New Math Workspace

We imported math.js and used it to have a special math workspace:

<lively-math />


### Parsing Errors

While starting to live in Lively4 there is this flow of little things to implement and fix... like displaying the error messages (or parse errors) directly in the editor:

```
"https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/src/client/html.js?1457454041464: Unexpected token (10:9)
   8 |   
   9 | 
> 10 |   static fixLinks(nodes, dir, followPath) {
     |          ^
  11 |     if (! followPath) {
  12 |       throw new Error("argument followPath missing");
  13 |     }
	Error loading https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/src/client/html.js?1457454041464"
```

But this has to wait for later... there is so much else to do that is not so fun as evolving Lively! Structural procrastination at its best!
