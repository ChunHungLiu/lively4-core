## 2016-11-04 Fun with Transformations,  #Jens

Marcel asked if we can still rotate a star in Lively4. I said no... but did not want to disappoint him in the end. 
```
function rotate(x) {

	that.style = "transform: perspective(2000px) rotateY("+x+"deg )";
		

	window.setTimeout(rotate, 10, x+0.4)
}

rotate(0)
```
