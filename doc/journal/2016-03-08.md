## 2016-03-08, International Women's Day!

And yet again, here it is... a Lively Journal. This time in a standard wiki in GitHub... and at the same time also as a [Lively page](https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/Wiki/Journal.md).

The journal is written using a unified browser inside a Lively4 page using a lively-container. 

- created a page describing [Lively4](Lively4)


### New Math Workspace

We imported math.js and used it to have a special math workspace:

<lively-math />


### Parsing Errors

While starting to live in Lively4 there is this flow of little things to implement and fix... like displaying the error messages (or parse errors) directly in the editor:

```
"https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/src/client/html.js?1457454041464: Unexpected token (10:9)
   8 |   
   9 | 
> 10 |   static fixLinks(nodes, dir, followPath) {
     |          ^
  11 |     if (! followPath) {
  12 |       throw new Error("argument followPath missing");
  13 |     }
	Error loading https://lively-kernel.org/lively4/src/client/html.js?1457454041464"
```

But this has to wait for later... there is so much else to do that is not so fun as evolving Lively! Structural procrastination at its best!
